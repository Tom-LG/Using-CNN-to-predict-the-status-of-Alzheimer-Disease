# Using-CNN-to-predict-the-status-of-Alzheimer-Disease

This project utilizes a dataset of MRI brain images from patients at different stages of Alzheimer's disease, sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinkumar413/alzheimer-mri-dataset. 

The dataset classifies patients into four categories:
- Class 1: Mild Demented
- Class 2: Moderate Demented
- Class 3: Non Demented
- Class 4: Very Mild Demented

The objective was to develop a CNN model capable of predicting the Alzheimer's disease status of a given patient based on their MRI scan. This notebook details the implementation and evaluation of this CNN-based prediction model.
